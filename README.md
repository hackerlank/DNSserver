# DNSserver
This is lightweight DNS server. When you surfing on line. Your computer has to translate a website address into an IP address. Even we have distributed DNS server, but it still cost a lot of time when translate the domain name into an IP address. So I wrote this software. It saves the most frequently used website IP address. So when you attempt to log in that site. The response time is approximately zero. And I have my own algorithm to when should my software to update the address pool. Like when the user away from keyboard, my software update addresses pools. Or update the IP address pool when no network traffic jam. 

Even now we have very famous DNS server software which name is BIND. But it can only run on Linux or Unix. But most users use Windows. Unfortunately, on Windows platform has seldom DNS server software. So I wrote one. And this software is used very little resource but has high efficiency.

I only upload the oldest version to this website. Because I sold this software to others later. According to the sale agreement. I can't put codes of the later version on a public area or show the codes to others.
